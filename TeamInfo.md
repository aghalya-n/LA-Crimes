## Project Summary
Our project will be a web application that allows users to learn more about the types and nature of crimes by neighborhood in Los Angeles, California. Users will be allowed to pick specific neighborhoods within the city they might be interested in, and learn more about that part of the city specifically, along with the crimes that occur most often there. Additionally, users will also be allowed to filter the information they see by crime. If there is a particular crime they are looking to avoid, users will be able to select that crime, see the damages it may cause, and the neighborhoods that it occurs in most often. 

This project allows users to have the information necessary to make the choices that can keep them most safe. Whether it be taking precautions while on a walk because of the high rates of crime in a specific neighborhood, or choosing to move to a specific neighborhood based on the security and crime rate, the information and data provided by this web app will allow users to make the decisions that feel right for them. Specifically, that information will include a visual of location, crimes that occur most often in a specific area, and crimes that occur regularly across different regions.
